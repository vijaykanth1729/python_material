Generally we have two types of error's in programming languages..
1) syntax error
2) Run time error

Syntax error:
-------------
occurs because of invalid syntax in the code..
eg:
----
for i in "vijay"
print(i)   # missing the indentation , colun at for loop...

def = "vijay"   # syntax error, because its a keyword in python

Run time Errors:
------------------
the errors which occurs after starting the execution of a program ....

There are so many reasons to occur run time errors..

with respect to every run time error corresponding run time representation class is available..

Run time errors technically we call as a exceptions..

To over come (handle exceptions)  this in python we have 3 blocks:
---------------------------------------------------

1) Try
2) Except
3) Finally

Try:
----
always store the code which are causing a error ,

Except:
-----------

Always gives or handles the exception and it will give the proper user understandable message as output..

Finally:
-----------

this block is used automatically every time... even we get an exception or even if we dont get an exception..
eg: file closing statements..
data base connection closing statements..
