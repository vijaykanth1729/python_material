Command line arguments:
------------------------

The concept of passing the values to the python interpreter at the time of running
the python program from the command prompt is called as command line arguments..

-> Python interpreter takes all command line arguments including
file name , create list object with those arguments and that object is stored in to the (argv)
variable of (Sys) module.

-> sys module is a predefined module
-> python file name is also taken as a  one of the command line arguments.
-> we can use the command line arguments in our python program by using sys.argv variable..
