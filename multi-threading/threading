Thread is a functionality or logic , which executes simultaneously along with other part of program.

(OR)

Thread is a light weight process.

To use threading concept in python we use builtin threading module..
that threading module contains a class called Thread.

we can run a thread by overriding (run) method of a thread class..

we can execute the functionality of a thread by calling (start)  method of thread class.

Scheduling:
-----------
Among multiple threads which thread has to start the execution first, how much time that thread has to execute
after allocated time is over which thread has to continue the excution next, is comes under scheduling..
Scheduling is highly dynamic..
** we can not predict the order of scheduling..

Suspending the thread is possible temporarily by calling the sleep() or join() method

sleep is a predefined function, which is defined in   time module..

sleep() stop the execution of current thread untill specified time is over..
