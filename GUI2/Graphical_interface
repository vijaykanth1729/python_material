GUI--->Desktop (GrpahicL uSER iNTERFACE ) Application Development:
----------------------------------
By using python we can implement standalone GUI applications for desktop...
-> There is a module which is prepackaged and installed automatically while installing python
--> module name  'tkinter' helps for creating graphical user interfaces...
-> this module has 'ton's of built in functions which can be used for creating
complicated desktop applications..

--> TO INSTALL any external modules in python 'we use a command line utlity called as PIP'
--> pip is used same as 'yum in centos or apt-get in ubuntu'
to install any module we use pip.
---------------------------------
eg:1) pip install pandas
2) pip install django   (django framework)
