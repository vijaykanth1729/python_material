File is a named location on the disk, which can able to store the data perminently..
Python program can open the file, read or write the data and close the file..
we can open the file by using one predefined function called as open()
At the time of opening the file by calling open(), we can specify the mode of the file..

Mode of the file indicates what type of the  operations are going to be performed on that file..

MODE                       Description
---------                 -------------
'r'                        open the file for reading (default, even if we dont specify it automatically takes)

'w'                        open the file for writing , and it creates a file if doesn't exist or truncate the file data if exists...

'a'                        open the file for appending , and it creates a new file if doesn't exist and it appends the data..

't'                         open in the text mode

'b'                         open the file which is binary format (like images, jpg, png etc)

'+'                         open a file for updating (reading & writing)

"x"                         - Create - Creates the specified file, returns an error if the file exists
