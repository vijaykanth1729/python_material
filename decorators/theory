Any variable which is preceeded by '@' character is know as a decorator.

-> every decorator should represents a function and we call that function as a decorator function.

->any function which is preceeded by decorator is known as a decorator function.

-> decorator takes in a function, adds some functionality & returns it, when ever we call
the decorated function that function internally passed as a parameter to the decorator function,
executes the decorator function and the return object of the decorator function is automatically called.
