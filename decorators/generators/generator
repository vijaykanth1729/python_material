Any function which contains one or more 'yield' statments is known as Generator.
->when ever we call the generator function, it interanally the logic of generator function will be taken,
implements a genrator protocol with that logic and returns iterable objects..

-> we can call the generator function by using 'next' function on it, so that it will start execution.
it executes upto one yield statment , pause the execution of the function and control comes out from the function .

-> once again if we call 'next' function . previuos yield statment to next yield statment it will execute.

** -> If no more yield statments in generator, then the function raises 'StopIterationException'

-> purpose of yield is to able to give the output till that point of code..


advantages:
-------------
Easy to implement..
Memory efficient
It can also represents infinite stream..
